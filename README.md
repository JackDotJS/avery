# avery
super cool bot for my discord/revolt server (big wip)

main features on the todo list:
- custom discord-revolt bridge
    - support for shared server emoji
    - support for deleting messages across both platforms (up to 24hrs old)
    - support for reactions (this will be *really* janky, but it'll technically work)
    - support for pinned messages (again, super janky, but it should work)
    - support for message replies (up to 24hrs old)
    - message buffering (save and resend messages when one platform/server is temporarily unavailable)
    - mirror announcement channel feeds and webhooks
    - synced modlog system
    - unfortunately, threads and forum channels are pretty much completely out of the question since revolt has nothing like them at all
- call mod command (aka "modping" from old projects)
    - should work cross-platform, ideally
- reaction roles
- (revolt only) timeout/mute command
